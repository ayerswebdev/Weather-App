# Weather-App

This is a refactoring of a project that I did when I was fairly early in my learning process on freeCodeCamp. As I worked on this project, there were a few key changes I wanted to make that reflect the learning I have done:
  1) Use CSS's flexbox display method in order to make a fluid, responsively designed web page
  2) Use CSS media queries to make the application look good regardless of the platform it is being viewed on
  3) Make the background dynamically change to reflect the weather conditions
  4) Implement a search function that allows the user to search for a location and get the weather there
